Let's now look beyond Bitcoin. Bitcoin blockchain is open-source and the entire code is available on the GitHub. During the initial 
years beginning roughly in 2009, this open-source code was extended to release different cryptocurrencies. About 300 plus cryptocurrencies 
were introduced. Bitcoin supports an optional and special feature called scripts for conditional transfer of values. Ethereum Blockchain extended
the scripting feature into a full-blown code execution framework called smart contract. A smart contract provide the very powerful capability 
of code execution for embedding business logic on the blockchain. Based on such capabilities, three major types of blockchains emerge from 
Bitcoin foundation. Type one deals with the coins in cryptocurrency currency chain. Example, Bitcoin. Type two supports cryptocurrency and 
a business logic layer supported by code execution. Example, ethereum. Type three involves no currency but supports software execution for
business logic. Example, The Linux Foundation's Hyperledger. With the addition of code execution, comes the serious consideration about public 
access to the blockchain hence, the classification of public, private, and permissioned blockchains based on access limits. We have been 
watching Bitcoin blockchain continuously operational since its inception. All supported by its public participants. Thus Bitcoin is a fantastic 
example of a public blockchain class. Anybody can join and leave as they wish. Transaction blocks and the blockchain are publicly observable 
even though participants are anonymous. It is open-source. You can also create new coin digital currency by modifying the Bitcoin code. Wallet 
applications provide the basic interface to transfer value through the Bitcoin blockchain. In a private blockchain, access to the blockchain
is limited to selected participants for example, those participants within an organization. This restriction helps in simplifying the normal
operations such as block creation and contingence model. The third classification of blockchain is permissioned blockchain, also called 
consortium blockchain. It is meant for a consortium of collaborating parties to transact on a blockchain for ease of governance, provenance,
and accountability for example, a consortium of all automobile companies or healthcare organizations. Permissioned blockchain has the benefits 
of a public blockchain with allowing only users with permission to collaborate and transact. In summary, significant innovations such as smart 
contracts have opened up broader applications for blockchain technology. 
Private and permissioned blockchain allow for controlled access to the blockchain enabling many diverse business models.
