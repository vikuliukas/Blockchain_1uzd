One of the oldest forms of tattooing originates in Polynesian cultures. A spiritual art form practiced on islands like New Zealand, 
Hawaii and Samoa, tattoos were used to tell the story of a person’s life with geometric symbols and patterns that had specific meanings. 
Black ink was applied in thick, dark patterns that often covered large portions of the body, and the process itself of getting tattooed was 
a sacred and spiritual undertaking – as well as painful. Many Polynesians today honour their culture by getting tattoos in the traditional 
designs of their ancestors, and sometimes even with the traditional tools. The Polynesian style has also become popular in Western cultures 
– often called “tribal” – though these modern interpretations are usually applied with a tattoo gun.
Sometimes called “old school”, this style of tattoo art is the oldest and most well-known Western form. It follows a strict set of design 
rules that make it easy to spot, such as a limited but bold colour palette, thick black outlines, immaculate precision and two-dimensional, 
crisp images. The development of traditional tattooing is often credited to the legendary Sailor Jerry (real name Norman Collins), who learned 
from Japanese artists and introduced his own American viewpoint to the artform. Common themes are nautical symbols, hearts, eagles, daggers 
and roses. This is the style proudly worn by the original counterculture rebels. 
As the name suggests, Neo Traditional tattoos are a modern take on the original old-school style. Considering that the latter became popular 
around the 1950s onward, it seems only natural that modern artists, armed with new tattooing techniques and fresh perspectives, would put their 
own spin on the genre. Neo traditional artwork stays true in many ways to its predecessor, featuring bold black lines and the classic colour 
palette. However, designs also often feature three-dimensional images, white ink and sometimes a departure from the traditional subject matter.
