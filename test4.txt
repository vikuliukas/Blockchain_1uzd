Here is the basic structure of a blockchain. Transaction is the basic element of the Bitcoin Blockchain. Transactions are validated and 
broadcast. Many transactions form a block. Many box form a chain through a digital data link. Blocks go through a consensus process, to 
select the next block that will be added to the chain. Chosen block is verified, and added to the current chain. Validation and consensus 
process are carried out by special peer nodes called miners. These are powerful computers executing software defined by the blockchain protocol. 
Let's now discuss the details of a single transaction in bitcoin. A fundamental concept of a bitcoin network is an Unspent Transaction Output, 
also known as UTXO. The set of all UTXOs in a bitcoin network collectively defined the state of the Bitcoin Blockchain. UTXO's are referenced as 
inputs in a transaction. UTXO's those are also outputs generated by a transaction. All of that UTXO's is in a system, are stored by the participant 
nodes in a database. Now let's review the role of the UTXO's in a Bitcoin Blockchain. The transaction uses the amount specified by one or more 
UTXOs and transmits it to one or more newly created output UTXOs, according to the request initiated by the sender. The structure of a given 
UTXO is very simple. It includes a unique identifier of the transaction that created this UTXO, an index or the position of the UTXO in the 
transaction output list, a value or the amount it is good for. And an optional script, the condition under which the output can be spent. 
The transaction itself includes a reference number of the current transaction, references to one no more input UTXOs, references to one or 
more output UTXOs newly generated by the current transaction, and the total input amount and output amount. Participants can validate the 
transaction contents. Does the UTXO's reference input exist in the network state? This is the only one of the many validation criteria.
